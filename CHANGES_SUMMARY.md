# 🎯 Form-Filling Agent - Final Configuration

## ✅ **Required Fields (Must Collect All 4)**

1. **Persona** (with titles & seniorities)
   - Job titles: CEO, CTO, VP, etc.
   - Seniority levels: Executive, Senior, Director

2. **Technologies**
   - Tech stack: Python, AWS, React, Salesforce, etc.

3. **Company Size**
   - Numeric: "50-200 employees"
   - Text: "small", "medium", "large"

4. **Revenue Range**
   - ARR in USD: "$10M-$50M"

## 🌎 **Auto-Filled (Never Asked)**

- **Location:** Always "United States of America"

## ❌ **NOT Required**

- Industry (recommended only)
- Funding Stage (recommended only)
- Founded Year (optional)

---

## 🔧 **Bugs Fixed**

### **Bug 1: Personas Stored as Strings**
**Problem:** Agent stored `personas: ['CEO']` instead of `personas: [{name: 'CEO', ...}]`

**Fixed:**
- Updated `_merge_fields()` to preserve persona objects
- Added defensive checks in `_evaluate_node()`
- Updated field extraction prompt to explicitly return persona objects
- Added warning logs if string personas detected

### **Bug 2: Agent Asking for Already-Provided Fields**
**Problem:** Parse node used AI to determine missing fields (unreliable)

**Fixed:**
- Parse node now ONLY extracts fields
- Evaluate node determines what's missing (deterministic)
- Clear separation of concerns

### **Bug 3: Funding Stage Asked as Required**
**Problem:** Agent asked for funding stage even though it's optional

**Fixed:**
- Removed from required_missing list
- Only added to recommended_missing
- Only asked after all 4 required fields are met

## 📊 **Coverage Calculation**

```
Total Weight: 13.5

Required (12.0 = 89%):
  ✅ Persona:      3.0
  ✅ Technologies: 2.5
  ✅ Company Size: 2.5
  ✅ Revenue:      2.0
  ✅ Location:     2.0 (auto)

Recommended (2.5 = 19%):
  • Industry:      1.0
  • Funding:       1.0
  • Founded Year:  0.5

Completion: required_ok AND coverage >= 80%
```

**Since required fields total 89%, completing all 4 required = automatic completion!**

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **Input:** "CEOs at tech startups"

**Agent extracts:**
- ✅ Persona: CEO (Executive)
- ✅ Industry: Technology (bonus)
- ✅ Company Types: Startup (info)
- ✅ Location: USA (auto-filled)
- ❌ Technologies: Not specified
- ❌ Company Size: Not specified
- ❌ Revenue: Not specified

**Agent asks:**
```
Please specify:
• Technologies the companies use
• Company size (employee count or small/medium/large)
• Revenue range (ARR in USD)
```

**What agent does NOT ask:**
- ❌ Persona (already has CEO)
- ❌ Location (auto-filled to USA)
- ❌ Industry (bonus field, not required)

## 🚀 **To Run & Test**

### **1. Start Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

### **2. Start Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### **3. Test Prompts**

**Test A: Minimal**
```
"CEOs at tech companies"
→ Should ask ONLY for: technologies, company_size, revenue_range
```

**Test B: Partial**
```
"CTOs using Python and AWS, medium-sized businesses"
→ Should ask ONLY for: revenue_range
```

**Test C: Complete**
```
"VPs of Sales at companies using Salesforce, 100-500 employees, $20M-$100M ARR"
→ Should say: "Your input is complete."
```
